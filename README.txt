Within this repository are four files: MandelbrotGUI.jar, MandelbrotDemo.m4v README.md, and this read me entitled README.txt. To download these files from GitHub, click on the “Download Zip” button in the bottom right hand corner of the page (https://github.com/Ezstein/MBFractal). Save the zip file onto your computer and extract out the files. MandelbrotDemo.m4v is video demonstration of the program. MandelbrotGUI.jar is the actual program. Ignore README.md. To run the program, right click on MandelbrotGUI.jar and press open. If that does not work, follow the directions below:

In order to run this program, java must be installed on the computer. For mac computers, java 6 should already be installed, but in some cases java 8 may be required. Macs that need java 8, and Windows computers must go to https://java.com/en/download/ to download it.

Both mac and windows computers may need to also install the java development kit which contains the runtime environment necessary to run the program. To do this, visit http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html and follow the directions to install the software. At this time the computer should be capable of running the program.

However, downloaded files are often blocked from opening when they come from an unrecognized developer. In order to open the MandelbrotGUI.jar file, you must right click on it and press open (as opposed to simply double clicking). A dialog box will open asking whether you are sure you want to open this file. Click open, and then the program should run.

Note that the program should function on any platform, but it has only been tested for macintosh computers. Many visual effects and performance stats will be platform dependent. I have tried to account for all possible issues with running this program, but there is always the chance that it will simply not work. If it does not work, then there is a movie file illustrating some of the features of the program.
